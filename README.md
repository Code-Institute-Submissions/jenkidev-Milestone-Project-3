## Scope

The scope of the project in itâ€™s first release is defined by the following features:

* Landing page with a clear navigation menu that can take unregistered users to News, Fixtures and a Contact form.
* Site must connect to MongoDB and display documents from the collection in a clear front end manner.
* Registered users can see player information. This protects personal information from unregistered users.
* Admin account is able to interact with all database information displayed using CRUD functionality.
* Allow User to sign in to the site or register if they are not already.
* Fully functional contact form with emailJS that will not submit unless all fields are filled out.
* A 404 error page that is styled and allows navigation back to the main page.
* A 500 error page in the event of a server error that is fully styled and directs back to the main page.
* Clear favicon that shows the site logo.

## Design of Site

### Initial idea

The main purpose of this site was to create a front end that would display collections from MongoDB. I decided to create a fake basketball team called the Bridgend Eagles (my local town). The Database would display news articles, players and fixtures of the team. An admin account would have permissions to update, delete and create new records. It would be fully responsive for desktop, tablet and mobile and would have a connection to the emailJS API to allow users to contact the site owner.

### Wireframes

To create the wireframes for this site I used the balsamiq cloud service. This allowed me to create a more basic wireframe. This was helpful as I have found in the past having a more complex and detailed wireframe to be quite restricting.

### Site Layout

The Site will have four main pages and these will be the news page, fixtures page, players page and contact page. These pages will be accessed via a nav bar at the top of the page. There will be two other sub pages a registration page and a sign in page and one more link in the nav bar where users can sign out.

#### News Page- 

#### Fixtures Page- 

#### Players Page-

#### Contact Page

#### SignIn and Registration Pages-

#### Sign Out Link- 


### Colour Choices


### Fonts
The font used for the site is the "Exo" font as this had quite a bold and easy to read style whilst also being curved, thus giving the website an approachable feel.

## Bug Squashing

| **Bug** | **Fix** |
|---------|---------|
When using the delete functionality for fixtures.html after selecting to delete on the confirmation modal a different collapsible selection would open and then get deleted as that was the active ID. | I am not sure why this happens as there is no trigger being clicked on I can only assume it is an interaction between the modal and collapsible classes of Materialize. Therefore in this case I have moved the delete fixture button to the edit_fixture.html page as this is only accessible to the admin and bypasses the bug.
