### User Story Tests

#### First-time User 


| **Feature Used** | **User Action** | **Expectation** | **Result** |
| ---------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ---------- |


## Bug Squashing

| **Bug** | **Fix** |
|---------|---------|
When using the delete functionality for fixtures.html after selecting to delete on the confirmation modal a different collapsible selection would open and then get deleted as that was the active ID. | I am not sure why this happens as there is no trigger being clicked on I can only assume it is an interaction between the modal and collapsible classes of Materialize. Therefore in this case I have moved the delete fixture button to the edit_fixture.html page as this is only accessible to the admin and bypasses the bug.

## Deployment

### Deploying to GitHub Pages



### Forking the GitHub Repository



### Cloning the GitHub Repository
